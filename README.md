# Data Science Game 2018 finals

This is the code my team -- [Geoffrey Bolmier](https://github.com/gbolmier), [Raphael Sourty](https://github.com/raphaelsty), [Adil Zouitine](https://github.com/AdilZouitine) -- and I submitted to the 2018 edition of the [Data Science Game](https://datasciencegame.com/), held in Chantilly, France. The competition was a hackathon which lasted 30 hours, 22 during which we managed to stay first. Then we fell asleep and ended up 7th out 20. We didn't really bother to clean up our code.
